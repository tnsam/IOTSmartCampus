# IOT Smart Campus
A smart campus project utilizes smart technologies to create new experiences and services. These smart technologies, which are connected to the Internet and AI-driven, allow different hardware on the campus to communicate with each other with less human intervention. It helps to improve various aspects of all the stakeholders including the students, teaching staff, or even canteen operators. The smart campus project consists of 3 main modules which are:

1. Smart Hall
2. Smart Canteen
3. Smart Library

In Smart Hall modules, it consists of several functions which include:
1. Smart Corridor Lights (To detect the surrounding light intensity) 
   -Switch on/off the corridor lights according to the surrounding light intensity
2. Smart Corridor Lights (To detect the surrounding light intensity) 
   -Adjust the brightness of corridor lights according to surrounding light intensity
3. Remote Control (Remote the electrical appliances such as light, projector and air conditioner through speech recognition)


In Smart Canteen modules, it consists of several functions which include:
1. Smart Entrance (To detect human movement and open the door when the sensor detected someone is close to the door)
2. Smart Seat Detector (To detect the number of seat available)
3. Smart Fire Detector (To detect the fire or flame and user can use the camera to check the stall condition when the flame sensor reach a certain threshold)


In Smart Library modules, it consists of several functions which include:
1. Smart Noice Detector (To detect voice volume/noise)
2. Smart Book Trolley (To detect the weight of the book on the book trolley)
3. Smart Door for Individual Room (To detect human movement and take picture of the use)
